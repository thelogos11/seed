# Ontology Project

This project uses GPT to generate ontologies, checks them with a reasoner, and iteratively refines them based on feedback.

## Structure

- `main.py`: Main script to run the ontology generation and refinement process.
- `functions.py`: Contains modular functions for ontology generation, conversion, reasoning, and refinement.
- `ontologies/`: Directory to store generated ontology files.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
